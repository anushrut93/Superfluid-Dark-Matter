# Superfluid-Dark-Matter

This folder contains multiple Jupyter notebooks that shows the numerical work I did as part of PhD research.
The notebooks use multiple results from the research papers that I published and the relevant papers are linked to in the appropriate notebook.
The broad idea of this work is to compute the equation of state of superfluids and using it to compute the density profile of dar matter superfluids.
We also show 3-d plots for the condensate fraction of these superfluids as a function of the temperature and interaction strength.
